# chatgpt-image-merger

Bash script for merging N-images into 1 image - horizontally, vertically or in Matrix (2x2, 2x3, 3x2, 3x3)

Generated by ChatGPT and adjusted by me.

Images in `convert` folder can have random names, but only `.jpg` extension is supported.

Images can also be named like `1.jpg 2.jpg 3.jpg`, to give custom order of merged images.

## prepare

1. put your files into "convert" folder (siblings to `script.sh`)

2. make `script.sh` executable

```
chmod +x script.sh
```

## run script

```
./script.sh -h
```

output will be written to "convert/image.jpeg"
 

## examples

merge vertically
```
./script.sh -v
```

merge horizontally
```
./script.sh -h
```

### "matrix" (supports 2x2, 3x2, 2x3)

merge 4 images into single image 2x2 (2 rows, 2 columns)
```
./script.sh 2x2
```


merge 3x2 (3 rows, 2 columns)
```
./script.sh 3x2
```

merge 2x3 (2 rows, 3 columns)
```
./script.sh 2x3
```

merge 3x3 (3 rows, 3 columns)
```
./script.sh 3x3
```
